**Abstract:** Drought is a natural hazard that stresses ecosystems, agricultural production, food security, and local economies. Given ongoing hydropower dam development in the Sesan and Srepok Basins, the two most dammed tributaries in the Lower Mekong Basin, characterizing baseline drought events and understanding how dams modify downstream flow are  needed to manage water resources and mitigate drought effects. We used the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to es-timate streamflow data from 2001 to 2019. For both rivers, we found that runoff varied, but con-tributed about 75% of streamflow, followed by shallow and deep groundwater, which contributed up to 25%. We used the Standardized Runoff Index to characterize drought and to detect  frequent, severe, and prolonged drought events in the two basins. Severe, prolonged droughts in the 2010–2011 and 2015–2016 periods corresponded to the occurrence of Typhoon Ketsana and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Streamflow alteration can be caused by climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities such as hydropower dam development and operations (e.g., the timing and magnitude of water releases). Results from this study can be used as a baseline to gauge po-tential future droughts and design appropriate drought management plans to preserve ecosystems and food security in the Lower Mekong Basin and its tributaries.
